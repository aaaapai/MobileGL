    // ===================== KNOWN DRIVER BUGS =====================
    //
    // THIS IS THE DESIGNATED HOME FOR DRIVER-CAPABILITY LIES.
    //
    // The rest of the POST suite answers a different question: does the extension exist, and
    // does a simple probe show it working. The entries here are not extension questions at
    // all - they are CORE functionality that a driver advertises, accepts without error, and
    // then does not perform. Nothing in an extension string or a limit query says so, which
    // is exactly why each one needs its own executable probe.
    //
    // The inventory comes from CAMPAIGN FINDINGS, not from anything the driver reports.
    //
    // EVERY PROBE MUST CARRY A CONTROL. The geometry entry below is why the rule is written
    // down: the same defect was first characterised as "this driver drops all geometry-stage
    // storage-buffer writes", which would have justified withdrawing
    // GL_MAX_GEOMETRY_SHADER_STORAGE_BLOCKS entirely. A control showed geometry-stage writes
    // land perfectly well when they precede EmitVertex(), so the limit is not a lie and
    // withdrawing it would have broken shaders that work today. A probe without a control
    // measures a symptom and invites exactly that over-correction.
    //
    // ADDING A SIBLING IS ONE FUNCTION: write an `Optional<DriverBugFinding> ProbeXxx(gl)`
    // that returns nullopt when the driver is not affected, and add it to the table in
    // CollectGlesKnownDriverBugs().

    // What MobileGL can do about a bug this device HAS. There is deliberately no "not
    // affected" member: a driver that passes the probe produces no finding at all, so the
    // report only ever lists bugs actually present on this device.
